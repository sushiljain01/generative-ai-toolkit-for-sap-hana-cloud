    - Change the default value of `long_term_db` parameter of `HANAMLRAGAgent` class from sqlite to HANA DB.
    - Added the `embedding_service` parameter to the `HANAMLRAGAgent` class to allow users to pass their own embedding service. The default embedding service has been changed from `GenAIHubEmbeddings` to `HANAVectorEmbeddings`.
    - Added `PAL CrossEncoder` as the default cross-encoder model for reranking in the `HANAMLRAGAgent` class. If it is not available, it will fall back to `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.

``Enhancements``
    - Save observations to chat history in HANA ML agent. Added max_observations parameter to control the number of observations saved in the chat history.

    - Added create_hana_sql_toolkit function to create a toolkit for HANA SQL.

    - Added parameter `return_direct` to all tools and toolkit.
    - Improved the `fetch_data` tool to return a pandas DataFrame instead of a list of dictionaries. By default, the tool parameter `return_direct` is set to `True`, which means the tool will return a pandas DataFrame.
